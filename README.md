# `romaji-me`

This utility transliterates japanese kana to roman letters using the Hepburn romanization.

Usage: `lua romaji-me <input>`
The terminal emulator you use must be UTF-8 capable.

As a side note, you probably noticed I specified that this utility works on kana, well, that is because it **only works on kana**.
You'll need to use another tool if you wish to transliterate kanji as well.
